# tracker

This is an app for tracking container shipments. Currently it only supports pilship, but could be trivially extended to support additional shipping lines.

It uses a basic Node/Express server for the API, and Ember.js for the frontend.

To build:

```shell
git clone <repo>
cd <repo>
ember build
sudo node server
```
